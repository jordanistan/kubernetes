## Fixing Ingress Issues with Minikube
If you're using Minikube to manage your containerized applications, you may run into issues when setting up an ingress. Fortunately, there are a few simple commands you can use to fix these issues.

## Setting the VM Driver
By default, Minikube uses the VirtualBox driver, which can sometimes cause issues with ingress. To fix this, you can set the VM driver to hyperkit with the following command:

```bash
minikube config set vm-driver hyperkit
```

This configures Minikube to use the hyperkit driver, which is more reliable when it comes to ingress.

Deleting Existing Clusters
If you have any existing Minikube clusters running, you'll want to delete them before starting a new one. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
minikube delete
``` 

This clears out any previous configuration issues and ensures that you can start fresh.

Starting a New Cluster
Once you've deleted any existing clusters, you can start a new one with the following command:

```bash
minikube start
```

This starts a new Minikube cluster with the hyperkit driver that you configured earlier.

Enabling the Ingress Add-On
Finally, you can enable the ingress add-on with the following command:

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

This installs the ingress controller into your Minikube cluster, allowing you to use ingress to route traffic to your services.

By using these four simple commands, you can fix ingress issues with Minikube and get back to managing your containerized applications. Keep in mind that these commands may not solve all ingress issues, but they're a good place to start if you're having trouble getting ingress to work in your Minikube environment.
